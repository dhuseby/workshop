Welcome to your first Python lesson! In this lesson, you'll write a simple program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.

## Introduction

"Hello, World!" is traditionally the first program you write when learning a new programming language. It's a simple way to make sure that your development environment is set up correctly and to learn the basic syntax of a language.

In Python, a "Hello, World!" program demonstrates:
- The main function, which is the entry point of every Python program
- How to print text to the console
- The basic structure of a Python project

## Your Task

Create a Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.

To complete this task:

1. Create a new file named `hello-world.py` in the current directory
2. Write a Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console
3. Run the check command to verify your solution

## Hint - Getting Started

To create a new Python file, you can use any text editor to create a file named `hello-world.py`.

Here's the basic structure of a Python program:

```python
def main() -> None:
    """Your code goes here"""

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

The `main` function is the entry point of your program. When you run your program, execution begins at the first line of the `main` function.

## Hint - Printing to the Console

In Python, you can print text to the console using the `print` function.

The syntax for printing a string is:

```python
print("Your text here");
```

## Hint - Complete Solution

Here's the complete solution:

```python
def main() -> None:
    """The main function of the program."""
    print("Hello, World!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

To run this program, you would typically use the `python hello-world.py` command, but for this lesson, the check command will compile and run your code for you.

## Conclusion

Congratulations on writing your first Python program! This simple example demonstrates the basic structure of a Python program and how to print text to the console.

As you progress through more lessons, you'll learn about variables, types, functions, and other Python features. But every Python program you write will start with a `main` function, just like this one.
